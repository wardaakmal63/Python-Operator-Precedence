#                            README FILE OF PYTHON OPERATOR PRECEDENCE USING BODMAS METHOD


This document explains the precedence of operators in Python, following the BODMAS rule (Brackets, Orders,
Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), and including the modulus operator `%`.

## Understanding Operator Precedence

In Python, when you write an expression, the order in which operations are executed is determined by the precedence of the operators involved.<br> 
This precedence dictates which operations are performed first when an expression contains multiple different operations. 

### The Order of Operations

1. **Brackets `()`**: Operations inside parentheses are performed first.<br>
2. **Orders `**`**: Exponentiation (raising to a power) comes next.<br>
3. **Division `/`, Multiplication `*`, and Modulus `%`**: These operations are on the same level and are performed from left to right.<br>
4. **Addition `+` and Subtraction `-`**: Finally, addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.<br>

### Detailed Examples

Letâ€™s break down a few examples to see how Python handles these operations.

#### Example 1

```python
result = 10 + 3 % 2 * 5 - 6 / 2


Step-by-step Evaluation:

Modulus %: 3 % 2 results in 1 (since the remainder of 3 divided by 2 is 1).
Multiplication * and Division /:
1 * 5 = 5
6 / 2 = 3

Addition + and Subtraction -:

10 + 5 = 15
15 - 3 = 12

Final Result: 12
```

#### Example 2

```python
result = (4 + 3) * 2 ** 2 / 2

Step-by-step Evaluation:

Brackets (): (4 + 3) results in 7.

Exponentiation **: 2 ** 2 = 4.

Multiplication * and Division /:

7 * 4 = 28
28 / 2 = 14

Final Result: 14
```
#### Example 3
```python
result = 8 / 4 * 2 + 3 ** 2 % 5

Step-by-step Evaluation:

Exponentiation **: 3 ** 2 = 9.
Division / and Multiplication *:

8 / 4 = 2
2 * 2 = 4

Modulus %: 9 % 5 = 4 (remainder of 9 divided by 5).

Addition +: 4 + 4 = 8.

Final Result: 8
```
#### Example 4
```python
result = 5 + 2 * (10 // 4) ** 3

Step-by-step Evaluation:

Brackets (): (10 // 4) results in 2 (integer division).
Exponentiation **: 2 ** 3 = 8.
Multiplication *: 2 * 8 = 16.
Addition +: 5 + 16 = 21.

Final Result: 21
```
## Key Takeaways:

1. **Parentheses `()`**: Always resolve expressions inside brackets first.<br>

2. **Exponentiation `**`**: Next, evaluate any powers or roots.<br>

3. **Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, and Modulus `%`**: These operators are on the same level, evaluated left to right.<br>

4. **Addition `+` and Subtraction `-`**: Finally, perform any addition or subtraction.<br><br><br>

#### Understanding and applying these rules ensures that you can accurately predict the result of complex expressions in Python.
